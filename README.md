# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction - Performance Evaluation with ML

This project implements **Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and SVM** algorithms to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset.  
The dataset is sourced from the **Seaborn library** (`sns.load_dataset('titanic')`).  

The main objective is to **compare the performance of multiple classifiers** on the same dataset and evaluate them using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

## âš¡ Features
- Loads Titanic dataset from **Seaborn**
- Preprocesses data (handles missing values, encoding categorical features)
- Implements **three ML models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Compares models based on:
  - âœ… Accuracy  
  - âœ… Precision, Recall, F1-score  
  - âœ… Confusion Matrix & Classification Reports
- Visualizes model performance
