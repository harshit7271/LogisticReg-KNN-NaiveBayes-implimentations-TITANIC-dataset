# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction - Performance Evaluation with ML  This project implements **Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes** algorithms to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset.   The dataset is sourced from the **Seaborn library** (`sns.load_dataset('titanic'))
